## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1. Open terminal => cd client(FE folder) => npm install => npm start (FE server ON)

   - I have created a sidebar that can be opened from the top right corner of the Hamburger icon.

2. Open terminal => cd server(BE folder) => npm install => npm start (BE server ON)

I hope there is no problem with the PORT
If there is any problem, please contact me.
The application was tested before being deployed.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Open SERVER [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Timeline:

- 23.03.2023 - Building FE & BE, I added all the functionality of the application.
- 24.03.2023 - Building & Implement FE "design".

  Sorry for my less than impressive design inspiration.
  If I will have a design, I am sure that I will be able to implement it as required.
